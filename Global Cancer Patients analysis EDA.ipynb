    "- Understand which characteristics in an individual is most likely to cause cancer. Characteristics includes age group, gender and region of the world the individual lives in. This could help the health industry target pateients earlier so that the appropriate tests can be carried out as preventative measures. Hospitals in certain areas can increase treatment equipment for certain cancers.\n",
    "- Understand which environmental risk causes each type of cancer. Again, this could be useful understand an individuals likelihood of getting a certain type of cancer depending on their environmental risk profile.  \n",
    "- Undersatnd which type of cancer has the longest survival time and cheapest treatment cost, as well as confirming whether it is region specific.\n",
    "- Use Machine learning to predict if an individual is likely to get a certain type of cancer based on the individual's profile and environmental factors. This could facilitate hospitals with early detection of cancer cases and prevent people from suffereing the illness."
