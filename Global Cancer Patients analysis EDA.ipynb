    "- Understand which characteristics in an individual is most likely to cause cancer. Characteristics includes age group, gender and region of the world the individual lives in. This could help the health industry target pateients earlier so that the appropriate tests can be carried out as preventative measures. Hospitals in certain areas can increase treatment equipment for certain cancers.\n",
